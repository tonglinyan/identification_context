  "text": "Historical linguistics is the study of language change, particularly with regards to a specific language or a group of languages. Western trends in historical linguistics date back to roughly the late 18th century, when the discipline grew out of philology[3] (the study of ancient texts and antique documents). Historical linguistics emerged as one of the first few sub-disciplines in the field, and was most widely practiced during the late 19th century.[4] Despite a shift in focus in the twentieth century towards formalism and generative grammar, which studies the universal properties of language, historical research today still remains a significant field of linguistic inquiry. Subfields of the discipline include language change and grammaticalisation.",
